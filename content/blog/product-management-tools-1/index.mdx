Which tool is the best? Still don't know..., but I made a small ranking to check which one is most popular (at least its website). Altogether 32 tools/pages. I collected data from Amazon Alexa and SimilarWeb.

### What are those numbers?

**Alexa** describes it as *global internet traffic and engagement over the past 90 days*.

**SimilarWeb** describes it as *sum of monthly unique visitors and pageviews globally*.

One thing worth to notice is that some of the tools might have (and usually have)
separate pages for their actual apps, and maybe in most of the cases, customers are not visiting the landing page.

## Takeaways

The project management software market is dominated by Atlassian (Trello and whole Atlassian Suite), which, according to some estimates, controls about 37% of the market. My research indicates that it might be even more. The numbers seem to confirm it.

Some of the tools might be very high on the list because of their universality (like Tello, Notion, or Miro). I'm sure they are useful during product development, but also for things like... wedding planning.

Numbers definitely say something, but at the same time, let's be careful in the assessment.

## Next steps
Those are the tools I'm going to compare in the future, so stay tuned and check my blog. Exciting stuff is coming!

If you want to discuss it, find me on LinkedIn, Twitter, or use the chat on the right bottom corner.
Also, contact me if you believe your tool should be listed here. I cannot promise anything (because I have to close it at some point and start comparison), but let know - in the worst case, it will appear on the next edition list.
